Descriptive analysis of a dataset provided to the Marketing course, University of Trento

At the Trento Faculty of Economics, I took a course in Marketing taught by professor Ernesto d'Avanzo. During one of these lectures, the professor provided us with an Excel spreadsheet, containing a sample of half a thousand e-commerce sites, in each of which is reported the presence or absence of 37 services, related to assisting the customer in choosing the product to buy. In addition, we were given feedback from a sample of consumers, regarding their appreciation of these services, on a scale of 1 to 5. The professor asked us to perform a graphical and descriptive analysis of this data set, and I decided to create a jupyter notebook and help him with Python. This is the result. (Still in progress)
